Abstraction is taking a large chunk of code and making it smaller.  In our case, we split everything up into classes that each do something unique.  I used abstraction by having everything in a separate class that could be called.  I also had all of the actors in a separate part of the cast.
Encapsulation is taking variables in a class and making them private, so only the methods in that class can access the variables.  I used Encapsulation by having getters and setters for the actors in my cast.
Inheritance allows us to make a new class that has the same methods as another class without needing to rewrite all of the methods in each class individually.   I used Inheritance by having some classes inherit from others like my player ship, boss, and bullets inherited from actor
Polymorphism allows us to require certain methods in classes for it to be run by the interpreter.  I used Polymorphism by making the classes inheriting from the action class require an "execute" method before running.
